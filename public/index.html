        <h3>The day I had the most fun </h3>
        <p> was when I was eight years old and was visiting
            Florida. My family was going to Disney World as part of a vacation. However, we
            had a free day and decided to visit the Kennedy Space Center. Seeing everything
            relating to the exploration of space and of sending man to the moon was astonishing.</p>
